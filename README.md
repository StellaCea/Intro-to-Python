# Intro-to-Python

## Exercise 1 ##
### Goals: ###
- Create developer environment 
- Create first python files

## Exercise 2 ##
### Goals ###
- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

### Task ###
I used a dictionary to store information about the recepes as it would provide a way to organize and store structured data in a readable format. Each recipe is represented as a dictionary with key (name, cooking time, and ingridients) and corresponding values).

For all recipes I considered using a list data structure as lists are easily iterated, and it is easy to add, reorder and remove recipes.
