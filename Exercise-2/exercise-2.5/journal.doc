Frontend Inspiration

Gluten-free recipes.
The website has a cute and visually appealing design. It makes use of a balance of bright colours that are vibrant but not overly vivid. I like the intuitive icons that represent various food categories. The inclusion of categories like “latest recipes”, “popular recipes”, and more, simplifies the browsing process and helps discover recipes more efficiently. 

2. The Food Blog: https://www.thefoodblog.net/
The website is well organized, categorizing recipes into different sections such as “breakfast”, “main meal”, “baking”, and more. Another standout feature is the inclusion of feedback stars/ratings beneath each recipe, and estimated cooking time. In terms of visual design, the website maintains a clean and straightforward appearance.

3. Eat Yourself Skinny: https://www.eatyourselfskinny.com/
Unusual and cute design with bright colors and interesting font, that sets it apart from more conventional websites.
