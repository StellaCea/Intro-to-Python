Data Analysis

I will use different charts to represent different aspects of the recipes. To illustrate amd compare the cooking time of different recipes I will use the plot chart. The difficulty level will be represented by a pie chart. For a comprehensive view of the number of ingredients used in recipes, I will employ a line chart.
